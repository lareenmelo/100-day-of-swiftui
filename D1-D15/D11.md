### PROTOCOLS
- According to Apple, a protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality.
```swift
protocol Identifiable {
    var id: String { get set }
}
```
- It is not possible to create a set only property in Swift.
- When you make a type use a protocol, it’s call conforming to *protocol name*
```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
    var id: String
}
```
- Protocols let us know how something should work. Swift will enforce these rules for us.

### PROTOCOL INHERITANCE
- Protocols can inherit from another protocol, and you can actually inherit from more than one protocol at the same time unlike classes 

```swift
protocol Payable {
    func calculateWages() -> Int
}

protocol NeedsTraining {
    func study()
}

protocol HasVacation {
    func takeVacation(days: Int)
}

protocol Employee: Payable, NeedsTraining, HasVacation { }
```
### EXTENSIONS
- Add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type
- You can’t add stored properties in extensions.

```swift
extension Int {
    func squared() -> Int {
        return self * self
    }
}

let number = 8
number.squared()
```
### PROTOCOL EXTENSIONS
- They’re like extensions, but instead of extending a specific type like Int, you extend a whole protocol, so that all conforming types get those changes.
```swift
let pythons = ["Eric", "Graham", "John", "Michael", "Terry", "Terry"]
let beatles = Set(["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"])

// protocol Collection
extension Collection {
    func summarize() {
        print("There are \(count) of us:")

        for name in self {
            print(name)
        }
    }
}

pythons.summarize()
beatles.summarize()
```
