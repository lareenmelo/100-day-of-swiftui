# Day 6

### CREATING BASIC CLOSURES
- Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code (functions without names)

```swift
// creates a function with no name and assigns that function to driving
let driving = {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}

driving() // you can call driving as a function
```
### ACCEPTING PARAMETERS IN A CLOSURE
```swift
let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}

driving("London")
```
### RETURNING VALUES FROM A CLOSURE
```swift
let drivingWithReturn = { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

let message = drivingWithReturn("London")
print(message)
```
### CLOSURES AS PARAMETERS
```swift
func travel(action: () -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action()
    print("I arrived!")
}

travel(action: driving)
```
### TRAILING CLOSURE SYNTAX
- If the last parameter to a function is a closure, then Swift lets us omit writing it, called trailing closure syntax, so rather than passing your closure as a parameter, you pass it directly after the func inside the braces. Example (using the previous travel function):

```swift
travel {
    print("I'm driving in my car")
}
```
