# Day 5
### WRITING FUNCTIONS
- Self-contained chunks of code that perform a specific task. 
- These chunks of code have a name that identifies what it does and you call this name to perform whatever you defined.

```swift
func printHelp() { //name that identifies what it does
    let message = """
Welcome to MyApp!

Run this app inside a directory of images and
MyApp will resize them all into thumbnails
"""

    print(message)
}

printHelp() // calls printHelp() function to execute its code
```

### ACCEPTING PARAMETERS
- You can send values to a function so they can be used inside to execute something. 
```swift
func square(number: Int) {
    print(number * number)
}

square(number: 8)
```
### RETURNING VALUES
- Functions can also send back data.
```swift
func square(number: Int) -> Int {
    return number * number
}

let result = square(number: 8) // grabbing the value that returns from our function.
print(result)
```
### PARAMETER LABELS
- With Swift we can provide two names for each parameter. 
    - One is used externally when calling the function
    - The other is internally inside the function. 

```swift
func sayHello(to name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

sayHello(to: "Taylor")
```
### OMITTING PARAMETER LABELS
- Adding an _  to skip argument labels (external) in functions.
```swift
func greet(_ person: String) {
    print("Hello, \(person)!")
}

greet("Taylor")
```
- This is used to provide a natural read naming convention.

### DEFAULT PARAMETERS
```swift
func greet(_ person: String, nicely: Bool = true) {
    if nicely == true {
        print("Hello, \(person)!")
    } else {
        print("Oh no, it's \(person) again...")
    }
}

greet("Taylor")
greet("Taylor", nicely: false)
```
### VARIADIC FUNCTIONS
- Functions that accept any number of parameters of the same type.
- Print is actually a variadic function (w.t.h)

```swift
func square(numbers: Int...) { // Int... = zero or more ints, Int = a single int
    for number in numbers {
        print("\(number) squared is \(number * number)")
    }
}

square(numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
### THROWING FUNCTIONS
- Sometimes function fails because they have bad input, or something went wrong. So functions can throw errors when this happens.
#### Writing throwing functions
```swift
enum PasswordError: Error {
    case obvious
}

func checkPassword(_ password: String) throws -> Bool {
    if password == "password" {
        throw PasswordError.obvious
    }

    return true
}
```
#### Running throwing functions
- To run throwing functions use do-try-catch

```swift
do {
    try checkPassword("password")
    print("That password is good!")
} catch {
    print("You can't use that password.")
}

```
- If any errors are thrown inside the do, execution immediately jumps to the catch block.

### INOUT PARAMETERS
- All parameters passed into a swift function are constants, so you can't change them.
- To work around this, you can pass parameters as `inout`, meaning, they can be changed inside your function, and those changes will be reflected in the original value outside your function. 

```swift
func doubleInPlace(number: inout Int) {
    number *= 2
}

var myNum = 10 
doubleInPlace(number: &myNum) // to pass this parameter, we need to use -> & (ampersand)
```
