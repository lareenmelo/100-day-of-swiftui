# Day 2

### ARRAYS
- Collection of values stored as a single value.
```swift 
let john = "John Lennon"
let paul = "Paul McCartney"
let george = "George Harrison"
let ringo = "Ringo Starr"

let beatles = [john, paul, george, ringo]
```
### SETS
- Collections of values just like arrays, except items aren’t stored in any order (random order) and no item can appear twice in a set (uniqueness).
- If you try to insert a duplicate item into a set, it gets ignored.
- Sets receive arrays
```swift 
let colors = Set(["red", "green", "blue"])
```
### TUPLES
- With tuples you can store values together in a single value. 
- Tuples are fixed in size (you can't add/remove items from tuples). 
```swift 
var name = (first: "Taylor", last: "Swift")
```
- You can access items in a tuple using numerical positions or by using their names.
```swift 
name.0 // Numerical positions
name.first // Name

```
### ARRAYS VS. SETS VS. TUPLES
|Array|Set|Tuple|
|:---|:---|:---|
|If you need a collection of values that can contain duplicates and where order matters |If you need a collection of values that have to be unique regardless of their position|if you need a specific fixed collection of values, where position is important|

### DICTIONARIES
- Dictionaries are like arrays, they store a collection of values, except that by accessing/storing things with a position it can be accessed them using a key (identifier).
```swift
let heights = [
    "Taylor Swift": 1.78,
    "Ed Sheeran": 1.73
]

// Accessing a dictionary
heights["Taylor Swift"]
```
#### Dictionary default values
- If you try to read a value from a key that doesn’t exist swift will send back **nil**. To change this you can add a default value.
```swift
let favoriteIceCream = [
    "Paul": "Chocolate",
    "Sophie": "Vanilla"
]

favoriteIceCream["Charlotte", default: "Unknown"] // Will print Unknown
```
### CREATING EMPTY COLLECTIONS
- Collections collect values in one place. To create any empty collection just add ()
```swift
var results = [Int]()
```
### ENUMERATIONS
- Enumerations define a common type for a group of related values
```swift
enum Result {
    case success
    case failure
}
// Usage
Result.failure
```
#### Enum associated values
- Enums can hold associated values attached to each case
```swift
enum Barcode {
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int)
    case qrCode(String)
}
```
#### Enum raw values
- Assings values to enums so they have meaning
```swift
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury = 1
    case venus
    case earth
    case mars
}
```
