### USING CLOSURES AS PARAMETERS WHEN THEY ACCEPT PARAMETERS
```swift 
func travel(action: (String) -> Void) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    action("London")
    print("I arrived!")
}

// calling travel()
travel { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
```
### USING CLOSURES AS PARAMETERS WHEN THEY RETURN VALUES
```swift
func travel(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}

// calling travel()
travel { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}
```
### SHORTHAND PARAMETER NAMES
- Since swift knows about the closure and its type, we don’t always have to explicitly define it 

```swift
func travel(action: (String) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London")
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}

// calling travel()
travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}
```
### CLOSURES WITH MULTIPLE PARAMETERS
```swift
func travel(action: (String, Int) -> String) {
    print("I'm getting ready to go.")
    let description = action("London", 60)
    print(description)
    print("I arrived!")
}

// calling travel()

travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) at \($1) miles per hour."
}
```
### RETURNING CLOSURES FROM FUNCTIONS
```swift
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    return {
        print("I'm going to \($0)")
    }
}

let result = travel()
result("London")
```
### CAPTURING VALUES
- Using any external values inside your closure makes swift capture them, store them alongside the closure so they can be modified even if the don’t exist anymore.

```swift
func travel() -> (String) -> Void {
    var counter = 1

    return {
        print("\(counter). I'm going to \($0)")
        counter += 1
    }
}

result("London")
result("London")
result("London")
// counter will go up (if it's up, then it's up, then it's up...)
```
