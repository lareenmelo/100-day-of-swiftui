### CREATING YOUR OWN STRUCTS
- They're a way to create your own types
- Structs can be given their own variables, constants, and functions

```swift
struct Sport {
    var name: String
}

var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis")
print(tennis.name)
```
### COMPUTED PROPERTIES
- A computed property is a property that runs code to figure out its value, every time it's called.
- Constants cannot be computed properties

```swift
struct Sport {
    var name: String
    var isOlympicSport: Bool

    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is an Olympic sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an Olympic sport"
        }
    }
}
```
### PROPERTY OBSERVERS
- Property observers let you run code before/after a property changes.

```swift
struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}

var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 80
progress.amount = 100
// the print section in amount will execute each time amount is modified.
```
### METHODS
- Functions inside structs are called methods (methods belong to a type, structs, enums and classes)

```swift
struct City {
    var population: Int

    func collectTaxes() -> Int {
        return population * 1000
    }
}

let london = City(population: 9_000_000)
london.collectTaxes()
```
### MUTATING METHODS
- If the struct has a var property but the instance of the struct was created as a let, that property can’t be changed.
- When you create the struct swift has no idea wether you will use it wit constants or variables, so it takes the safe approach, swift won’t let you echange properties unless you specifically request it

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String

    mutating func makeAnonymous() {
        name = "Anonymous"
    }
}

var person = Person(name: "Ed")
person.makeAnonymous()
```
### PROPERTIES AND METHODS
#### Strings
- Strings are structs, they have their own methods, and properties we can use to query and manipulate the string.

```swift
let string = "Do or do not, there is no try."

print(string.count) // returns number of characters in a string
print(string.hasPrefix("Do")) // returns true if the string starts with specific letters
print(string.sorted()) // sorts the letter of string into an array
```
#### Arrays
- Arrays are also structs :exploding_head:


```swift
var toys = ["Woody"]

print(toys.count) // returns the number of items in an array
toys.append("Buzz") // adds new item to the array
toys.firstIndex(of: "Buzz") // locates an item within the array
toys.remove(at: 0) // removes an item in the specified location
```

:relieved:
