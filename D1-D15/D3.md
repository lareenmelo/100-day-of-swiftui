# Day 3

### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
- Swift can handle: 
    - `+` for addition 
    - `-` for subtraction
    - `*` for multiplication
    - `%` modulo operator, It calculates how many times one number can fit inside another, then sends back the value that’s left over.
```swift
let remainder = 13 % secondScore
```
### OPERATOR OVERLOADING
- Means that what an operator does depend on the values you use. Example:
```swift
let doubleMeaning = 42 + 42 // + operator sums numbers

let fakers = "Fakers gonna "
let action = fakers + "fake" // but also joins strings

let firstHalf = ["John", "Paul"]
let secondHalf = ["George", "Ringo"]
let beatles = firstHalf + secondHalf // and arrays!
```
### COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
- These operatos are the combination of one operator with an assignment, so you can change a variable in place. Example:
```swift
var score = 95
score -= 5
```
### COMPARISON OPERATORS
- Equality checks, example:
    - `==` (checks two values are the same) 
    - `!=` (not equals - checks two values are not the same)
- Greater, greater than: `>`, `>=`
- Less, less than: `<`, `<=`

### CONDITIONS
- These are conditions that when given, and if that condition is true it will run code of your choosing.
```swift
let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10

if firstCard + secondCard == 2 {
    print("Aces – lucky!")
} else if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    print("Blackjack!")
} else {
    print("Regular cards")
}
```
### COMBINING CONDITIONS
- There are operators that lets us combine conditions:
    - `&&` (and)
    - `||` (or)
```swift
let age1 = 12
let age2 = 21

if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {
    print("Both are over 18")
}
```
### THE TERNARY OPERATOR
- Operator that checks a condition specified in the first valued, if true, returns second value the third value if its false
```swift
let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10

print(firstCard == secondCard ? "Cards are the same" : "Cards are different")
```
### SWITCH STATEMENTS
- Considers a value and compares it against several possible matching cases. Once matches, it executes de designated blcok of code.
- Switch statements, meaning they must always cover all possible cases (using a default will cover cases we don't know about but must handle).
```swift
let weather = "sunny"

switch weather {
case "rain":
    print("Bring an umbrella")
case "snow":
    print("Wrap up warm")
case "sunny":
    print("Wear sunscreen")
    fallthrough
default:
    print("Enjoy your day!")
}
```
- If you want execution to continue on to the next case, then use `fallthrough`.

### RANGE OPERATORS
- There are two ways of making ranges:
    - `..<` (half-open range operator): creates ranges up to but excluding the final value.
    -`...` (closed range operator): creates ranges up to and including the final value

```swift
let score = 85

switch score {
case 0..<50:
    print("You failed badly.")
case 50..<85:
    print("You did OK.")
default:
    print("You did great!")
}
```
