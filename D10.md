# Day 10

### CREATING YOUR OWN CLASSES 
- Classes are similar to structs, the allow u to create new types with properties and methods, but they have five differences
- First, classes don't come with a `memberwise intializer`, so always initialize your properties accordingly with an initializer

```swift
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String

    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}

let poppy = Dog(name: "Poppy", breed: "Poodle")
```
### CLASS INHERITANCE
- Second difference, you can create a class based on existing class. It inherits all the properties and methods of the original class, and can add its own on top (this is known as `class inheritance` or, `subclassing`). 

```swift
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String

    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}

class Poodle: Dog {
    init(name: String) {
        super.init(name: name, breed: "Poodle")
    }
}
```
### OVERRIDING METHODS
- Replacing parents methods with their own implementations.
```swift
class Dog {
    func makeNoise() {
        print("Woof!")
    }
}

class Poodle: Dog {
    override func makeNoise() {
        print("Yip!")
    }
}

let poppy = Poodle()
poppy.makeNoise() // Yip!
```
### FINAL CLASSES
- Declaring a class final means no other class can inherit from it.

```swift
final class Dog {
    var name: String
    var breed: String

    init(name: String, breed: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    }
}
```
### COPYING OBJECTS
- When you copy a class, the original and the copy point the same reference, so changing one does change the other.
```swift
class Rapper {
    var name = "Megan Thee Stallion"
}

var rapper = Rapper()
print(rapper.name) // Megan Thee Stallion

var rapperCopy = rapper
rapperCopy.name = "Tina Snow"

print(rapper.name) // Tina Snow
```
### DEINITIALIZERS
- Code that gets run when an instance of a class is destroyed

```swift
deinit {
    print("\(name) is no more!")
}
```
### MUTABILITY
- With classes, even if you define them as a constant (`let`), you can still change properties if they are defined as variables (`var`) within that class.
