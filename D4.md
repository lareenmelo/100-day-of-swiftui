# Day 4
### FOR LOOPS
- For loops loop over arrays and ranges.
```swift
let albums = ["Red", "1989", "Reputation"]

for album in albums {
    print("\(album) is on Apple Music")
}
```
### WHILE LOOPS
- Reads as: check for this condition, then execute the code block as many times as it applies.
```swift
var number = 1

while number <= 20 {
    print(number)
    number += 1
}

print("Ready or not, here I come!")
```
### REPEAT LOOPS
- Reads as: execute this block of code, while the condition applies.
- The condition block executes at least once because the check comes after the code block execution.

```swift
repeat {
    print("This is false")
} while false
```
### EXITING LOOPS
- To exit a loop at any time use the `break` keyword.

```swift
while countDown >= 0 {
    print(countDown)

    if countDown == 4 {
        print("I'm bored. Let's go now!")
        break
    }

    countDown -= 1
}
```
### EXITING MULTIPLE LOOPS
- To exit from nested loops we need to:
    - Give the outer loop a label
    - Use break labelGivenToTheOuterLoop
    
```swift
outerLoop: for i in 1...10 {
    for j in 1...10 {
        let product = i * j
        print ("\(i) * \(j) is \(product)")

        if product == 50 {
            print("It's a bullseye!")
            break outerLoop
        }
    }
}
```
### SKIPPING ITEMS
-  To skip the current item and continue on to the next one use the `continue` keyword.
```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
        continue // if number is odd skip :)
    }

    print(i)
}
```
### INFINITE LOOPS
- Loops that either have no end or only end when youâ€™re ready
```swift
var counter = 0

while true {
    print(" ")
    counter += 1

    if counter == 273 {
        break
    }
}
```
