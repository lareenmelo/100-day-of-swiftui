| learned that property wrappers can become structs and store values, custom bindings, and worked with ActionSheet. | learned about core image and, how to wrap a UIViewController in a SwiftUI view (UIViewControllerRepresentable). | last technical day before starting the project tomorrow. Today I learned about coordinators in SwiftUI ( != Coordinator Pattern) and worked with photo library. | started project #13! Consolidated what I learned from the past three days and built an app that lets people import photos from their library, and modify the picture using filters (the filters feature be implemented tomorrow). | completed the project. Finished adding the list filters you can apply to an image and, saved an image to library.  |  completed the challenges for the project! Added validation alerts, UI improvements and two slider features ☺️ |

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/instafilter-wrap-up):
>1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
>2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
>3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
