| learned that property wrappers can become structs and store values, custom bindings, and worked with ActionSheet. | learned about core image and, how to wrap a UIViewController in a SwiftUI view (UIViewControllerRepresentable). | last technical day before starting the project tomorrow. Today I learned about coordinators in SwiftUI ( != Coordinator Pattern) and worked with photo library. | started project #13! Consolidated what I learned from the past three days and built an app that lets people import photos from their library, and modify the picture using filters (the filters feature be implemented tomorrow). | completed the project. Finished adding the list filters you can apply to an image and, saved an image to library.  |
