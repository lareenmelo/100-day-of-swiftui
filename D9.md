# Day 9

### INITIALIZERS
- Initializers are special methods that provide different ways to create a struct
```swift
struct User {
    var username: String

    init() {
        username = "Anonymous"
        print("Creating a new user!")
    }
}

var user = User()
user.username = "twostraws"
```

- All structs come with one default init, called `memberwise initializer`
    - Basically, a **memberwise intializer** accept values for each of the structs properties
    - If any of your properties have default values, then theyâ€™ll be incorporated into the initializer as default parameter values, making it so that you initialize only the parts that you need to.
    - Once you create your own init, swift removes the `memberwise initializer`

```swift
struct User {
    var name: String
    var yearsActive = 0
}

let roslin = Employee(name: "Laura Roslin")
let adama = Employee(name: "William Adama", yearsActive: 45)
```

### REFERRING TO THE CURRENT INSTANCE
- Inside methods we get a special constant called self, which points to current instance the struct is being used in.

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        print("\(name) was born!")
        self.name = name
    }
}
```
### LAZY PROPERTIES
- Properties that are created only when needed

```swift
struct FamilyTree {
    init() {
        print("Creating family tree!")
    }
}

struct Person {
    var name: String
    lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree() // we might not need a family tree for every person

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var ed = Person(name: "Ed")
```
### STATIC PROPERTIES AND METHODS
- When we create instances of the same struct each of them have their own properties and methods. 
- You can ask swift to share specific properties and methods by using static

```swift
struct Student {
    static var classSize = 0
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        Student.classSize += 1
    }
}

let ed = Student(name: "Ed")
let taylor = Student(name: "Taylor")

print(Student.classSize) // 2
```
### ACCESS CONTROLS
- Access control lets you restrict which code can use properties and methods.

```swift
struct Person {
    private var id: String

    init(id: String) {
        self.id = id
    }

    func identify() -> String {
        return "My social security number is \(id)"
    }
}
```
