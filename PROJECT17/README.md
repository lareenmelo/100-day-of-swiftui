| learned about gestures, haptics (core haptics and reviewed UINotificationFeedbackGenerator 🤯), and contentShape which is a modifier that lets us specify the taxable shape of something | learned about Timer, Publishers, Combine, app notifications like knowing when your app goes to background, and supporting  accessibility settings! | created the initial UI for the app. Built a fun stack of cards, added the swipe gestures and the cards text | | | |

| worked on the flashcards, added colors so we can tell when we had an answer right or wrong, and added a timer. | fixed some bugs (including the card's fast animation that was happening) and now users can add their own cards to practice with (it uses user defaults as persistence). | another set of challenges destroyed (jk those challenge destroyed me). Completed the 3 challenges for the flash cards app! I had to fix a color related bug, add haptics for when the timer finished and a new settings feature! :) |
