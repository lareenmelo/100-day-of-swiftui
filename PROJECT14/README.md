| learned about Comparable, operator overloading, FileManager, writing data to the documents directory, and handling a View's state using Enums.  | worked with MapKit, UIViewRepresentable, and LocalAuthentication (used it to work with Touch ID and Face ID).  | worked more with MKMapView, MKPointAnnotation, got more comfortable with coordinators, and many MapKit delegate methods ðŸ˜­. | continued with the project, we can now edit a location, and we added a section that displays nearby places to visit. This was used using URLSession to get data from Wikipedia. |  |  |
