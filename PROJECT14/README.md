https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/68

> ...  an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

## Topics
Comparable, operator overloading, FileManager, MVC, MapKit, LocalAuthentication, NSError, MKPointAnnotation, MKMapView

| learned about Comparable, operator overloading, FileManager, writing data to the documents directory, and handling a View's state using Enums.  | worked with MapKit, UIViewRepresentable, and LocalAuthentication (used it to work with Touch ID and Face ID). | worked more with MKMapView, MKPointAnnotation, got more comfortable with coordinators, and many MapKit delegate methods ðŸ˜­. | continued with the project, we can now edit a location, and we added a section that displays nearby places to visit. This was used using URLSession to get data from Wikipedia. | worked with authentication today, now you have to use biometrics (if there's any) to access your saved locations and there's persistence (saving to the documents directory) | completed the challenges for the project. Added error handling (when biometrics fails there's an alert that shows an error message) and code cleanup! |

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up):
>1. Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button â€“ what difference does it make, and can you think why?
>2. Having a complex `if` condition in the middle of `ContentView` isnâ€™t easy to read â€“ can you rewrite it so that the `MapView`, `Circle`, and `Button` are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!
>3. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one `alert()` modifier to each view.
