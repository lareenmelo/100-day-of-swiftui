## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/drawing-wrap-up):
>1. Create an `Arrow` shape made from a rectangle and a triangle â€“ having it point straight up is fine.
>2. Make the line thickness of your `Arrow` shape animatable.
>3. Create a `ColorCyclingRectangle` shape that is the rectangular cousin of `ColorCyclingCircle`, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using a property.
